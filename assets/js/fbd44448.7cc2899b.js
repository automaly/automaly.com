In Dynamics AX 2012, these symbols are highly visible during the filtering experience. For example, for the filter by grid option, if a user selects the ',(0,r.jsx)(t.strong,{children:"contains"})," operator on a field, the system translates that operator by adding wildcard characters (*) to each end of the current expression. In the current version, the query symbols are implied by the selected operator and aren't injected into the user interface. This makes filtering more intuitive and simpler for users. For users who want to specify additional filter conditions by using specific query symbols, or users who must enter more complex conditions, the ",(0,r.jsx)(t.strong,{children:"matches"}),' operator is provided for each data type. For all other operators, the query symbols are interpreted as literals. For example, the filter condition "First name MATCHES A" finds all records where the first name starts with the letter A.
